# Godot Template - Lospec Jam 3
The following project is meant to help developers get developing their jam game more quickly. It is setup as a pixel art project that will maintain the resolution required by the jam restrictions.

A number of other features have been included as well, though these may need to be tailored to specific projects.

The project requires Godot 4.3 RC 1 (available at https://godotengine.org/download/preview/) due to specific improvements to pixel art projects and project structure refactoring within the Godot editor.
